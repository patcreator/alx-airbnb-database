-- Task 1: Practice Subqueries
-- =====================================

-- 1️ Non-correlated subquery
-- Find all properties where the average rating is greater than 4.0
SELECT
    Property.property_id,
    Property.name,
    Property.location
FROM Property
WHERE Property.property_id IN (
    SELECT Review.property_id
    FROM Review
    GROUP BY Review.property_id
    HAVING AVG(Review.rating) > 4.0
)
ORDER BY Property.property_id;


-- 2️ Correlated subquery
-- Find users who have made more than 3 bookings
SELECT
    User.user_id,
    User.first_name,
    User.last_name,
    User.email
FROM User
WHERE (
    SELECT COUNT(*)
    FROM Booking
    WHERE Booking.user_id = User.user_id
) > 3
ORDER BY User.user_id;
