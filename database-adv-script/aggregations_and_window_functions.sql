SELECT
    User.user_id,
    User.first_name,
    User.last_name,
    COUNT(Booking.booking_id) AS total_bookings
FROM User
LEFT JOIN Booking
ON User.user_id = Booking.user_id
GROUP BY User.user_id, User.first_name, User.last_name
ORDER BY total_bookings DESC;


-- 2️ Window Function (RANK)
-- Rank properties based on the total number of bookings received
SELECT
    Property.property_id,
    Property.name AS property_name,
    COUNT(Booking.booking_id) AS total_bookings,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (
        ORDER BY COUNT(Booking.booking_id) DESC
    ) AS booking_rank
FROM Property
LEFT JOIN Booking
ON Property.property_id = Booking.property_id
GROUP BY Property.property_id, Property.name
ORDER BY booking_rank;
